Lilah has a string, s, of lowercase English letters that she repeated infinitely many times.Given an integer, n, find and print the number of letter a's in the first n letters of Lilah's infinite string.

For example, if the string s = 'abcac' and n = 10, the substring we consider is abcacabcac, the first 10 characters of her infinite string. There are  4 occurrences of a in the substring.

Ans::

# Complete the repeatedString function below.
def repeatedString(s, n):
    c = ''
    while len(c) < n:
        for x in s:
            if len(c) < n:
                c += x
    
    Dict = {}

    for i in c:
        Dict[i] = c.count(i)
    print(Dict['a'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    result = repeatedString(s, n)
    
O/P::
